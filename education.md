<h2>BSc(Eng) Mechatronics</h2>
<p class="subtitle">2016 - 2019</p>
<p>
  Mechatronics is a versatile degree, combining aspects of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, & computer science. I have found the curriculum very stimulating, and I have enjoyed expanding my knowledge in such a wide range of topics. I have been exposed to fields such as systems control & automation, electronics design, power electronics, and image processing to name a few, and my focus in my final year is predominantly on machine learning applications.

<h3>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</h3>
<p>
  In 2012, and again in 2015, I was part of the production team responsible for two plays performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (Biloxi Blues, and Cold Stone Jug respectively). The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is one of the most highly acclaimed drama and culture festivals in the world. Aside from being an exciting travel experience, these two trips taught me about working to a very tight schedule in an unfamiliar location, and about managing a team to overcome unforeseen setbacks.

<h3>Chile Exchange</h3>
<p>
  In 2013, I was selected to take part in a two-month student exchange to Curic√≥, Chile. While in Chile, I stayed with a host family and attended Orchard College High School. I could speak barely any Spanish, so I joined some of the grade 3 and 4 classes, where I helped the younger kids improve their English.
