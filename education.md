<h2>Takealot Graduate Program</h2>
<p class="subtitle">2020</p>
<p>
  Takealot's graduate program is aimed at fresh graduates and young professionals looking to kickstart their careers with one of South Africa's quickest growing brands. The program begins with four weeks of seminars covering all the critical aspects of onboarding, ensuring that everyone is brought up to speed on the diverse tech stack, operating procedures in different areas of the company, and the general organization structure. This is followed by four weeks working with other graduates and mentors to complete a project. This is an amazing hands-on opportunity to work in teams and get some experience with parts of the stack. If the project is a success, it will then be refined and hopefully see real use in production.
</p>
<h3>Short Courses</h3>
<p>
  Takealot has partnered with <i>MyAcademy</i> to provide access to educational content and short courses. During my onboarding, I completed courses on <b>gRPC</b> and <b>shell scripting</b>, which I found very helpful in bridging the gap from my engineering degree into a software development role.

<h2>BSc(Eng) Mechatronics</h2>
<p class="subtitle">2016 - 2019</p>
<p>
  Mechatronics is a versatile degree, combining aspects of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. I found the curriculum very stimulating, and enjoyed expanding my knowledge in a wide range of topics. My courses and projects have given me exposure to fields such as systems control & automation, electronics design, and image processing to name a few. In my final year, I focused predominantly on machine learning applications for image and radar signal processing.

<h3>Awards & Achievements</h3>
<p>
  I was awarded a <b>Faculty Entrance Scholarship</b> based on my matric results, and earned a place on the <b>Dean's Merit List each year</b>. In 2016 I received the <b>Class Medal for Introduction to Electronics</b>, and a <b>Computer Science Merit Award</b>. In 2017 I was invited to join the <b>Golden Key International Honour Society</b> based on my academic performance. I maintained a high academic standard, with a <b>GPA of 80%</b>, and my final year project was recognized as the <b>Best Machine Learning Project in the Electrical Engineering Department</b> (check out my <a href="projects">projects page</a> for more info on that). My full academic transcript is available below.

<h3>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</h3>
<p>
  In 2012, and again in 2015, I was part of the production team responsible for two plays performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (Neil Simon's <i>Biloxi Blues</i>, and Herman Charles Bosman's <i>Cold Stone Jug</i> respectively). The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is one of the most highly acclaimed drama and culture festivals in the world. Aside from being an exciting travel experience, these two trips taught me about working to a very tight schedule in an unfamiliar location, and about managing a team to overcome unforeseen setbacks.

<h3>Chile Exchange</h3>
<p>
  In 2013, I was selected to take part in a two-month student exchange to Curic√≥, Chile. While in Chile, I stayed with a host family and attended Orchard College High School. I could speak barely any Spanish, so I joined some of the grade 3 and 4 classes, where I helped the younger kids improve their English.
