<h2>Creator</h2>
<p>
  I am an engineer at heart, and I see the world as my sandbox. Whether it's a custom phone mount for my motorcycle, or a purpose-built smart wine cellar, I enjoy putting my skills to the test, balancing elegance & novelty at every step. I often revisit designs many times over until it feels complete, with the right mix of ingenuity, practicality, and flare.
</p>

<h2>Innovator</h2>
<p>
  I strive to constantly expand my knowledge and expertise, and not shy away from difficult problems. My curiosity drives me to try new design philosophies, construction techniques, or materials, just to see what might happen, which inevitably uncovers something new I didn't know beforehand. I enjoy this freedom to explore a problem space and try different approaches, usually resulting in more tailored solutions.

<h2>Fabricator</h2>
<p>
  Taking a project from concept or design through to production is something I find very rewarding. I am particularly interested in the reality of manufacturing (as opposed to the theory of design), and how seemingly innocuous design decisions can sometimes make a world of difference when it comes time to actually make a part. Understanding the manufacturing capabilities available to me is always a large part of my design process. Manual or CNC? Weld or bolt? Number and order of operations? - I enjoy trying to make my designs production-friendly.
