  As part of my engineering studies, I took part in a six-week internship at Aerobotics (Pty) Ltd, where I was very involved in image processing and worked to streamline the process of stitching hundreds of images into a single orthographic image for further processing.

<h3>Club Electron</h3>
<p class="subtitle">2017 - Present</p>
<p>
  At school, I often tinkered with electronics in my spare time, which was a huge help in preparing me for engineering at UCT. I started working with Club Electron in 2017 because I believe that more kids need to be exposed to electronics and coding at a young age to hopefully inspire them to pursue hobbies or careers in STEM fields. The program is run as an extra-curricular activity at schools all over Cape Town, aimed at grades 4-7. I have worked as an instructor at a number of schools, guiding the kids through the topics and helping them understand, build, and test their creations.

<h3>SkillUp Tutors</h3>
<p class="subtitle">2016 - Present</p>
<p>
  I began working with SkillUp as a private tutor in 2016, which has allowed me to share my love of math and science with others. What began as a way to earn a little pocket money has become a passion for empowering struggling students to achieve the results they know they are capable of. I have worked with students in high school and at university, from all over the Southern Suburbs. I tend to work most on math and physics, and I love seeing my students grapple with and grasp the content which they previously found challenging. I particularly enjoy building lasting relationships with my students, where I can be a part of their progress towards achieving the results they desire.
